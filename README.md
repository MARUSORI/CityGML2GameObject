# CityGML2GameObject
A tool to import CityGML as GameObjects at runtime

This is abandoned for now but can function as a starting point for a proper implementation.

Implemented:

- Import from CityGML to mesh and GameObject
- Basic understanding of semantic surfaces
- Different materials for semantic surfaces

Todo:

- Documentation
- Bugfixing (Unproccessed surfaces are added under the root of the scene)
- Textures
- Refactoring, SoC
- ...
